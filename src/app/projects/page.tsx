                    longDescription="PulseLink is a wearable device prototype that helps people find their friends in crowded indoor environments (like parties and festivals) where smartphones often fail. The device uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology with fixed anchor points to triangulate user positions, and features a minimalist 8Ã—8 LED matrix that displays real-time directional and proximity cues without requiring users to look at a screen. By combining BLE positioning with peer-to-peer signal strength measurements, PulseLink provides indoor location tracking that traditional GPS-based solutions cannot offer."
