The device uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology with fixed anchor points to triangulate user positions, and features a minimalist 8Ã—8 LED matrix that displays real-time directional and proximity cues without requiring users to look at a screen. By combining BLE positioning with peer-to-peer signal strength measurements, PulseLink provides indoor location tracking that traditional GPS-based solutions cannot offer.",
